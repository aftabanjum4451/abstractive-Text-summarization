It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.\n","\n","Review # 4\n","Cough Medicine\n","If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.

There is no escaping the fact  however  that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation. Still  the McCann s is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It s even better than the organic  all natural brands I have tried. All the varieties in the McCann s variety pack taste good. It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br  ><br  >McCann s use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product. Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like  though  is McCann s use of thickeners. Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy  tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.

The Apples   Cinnamon  though  tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty seven seconds  so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br  > The only bad thing    if you can consider it a bad thing    about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you will end up with six ten count boxes.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea  diarrhea   headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell. I thought I d found sugar free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in. The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping. As the symptoms passed  this too was very unpleasant. Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit  all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar free popcorn at my local market. The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy  new sugarfree treat taste so good  my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener  down to the very bottom of the label and read  maltitol  in tiny little letters  Thank goodness I d eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart s content but others  like me  can have a bad reaction to it.

I am about to make one for a pie auction at church  after a friend requested that something  strawberry  should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively  healthy  fruit tarts by baking a base  layering it with uncooked  fresh  sliced fruit  then pouring over the made up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature  hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart  and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes  to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally  I do not like cheesecake  too rich for me  but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous  I will admit. To do this  slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it is still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze  let it set up and then remove the springform. You ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries  strawberries or sliced mangos are nice  but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons  that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br  ><br  >I use a base of sponge cake  baked in a shallow form  but other bases can be pate sucre  a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie  that works well in those fluted  straight sided forms. You can also make mini tarts in a muffin pan  pre baking each mold with a layer of pie crust  even commercial crust works  though again  I prefer pate sucre  it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.  Just blind bake the muffin tins lined with pate  then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits  berries are great  and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie  which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br  ><br  >If you get into baking  this glaze is a must have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan  tapioca starch  carrageenan  dextrose  cream of tartar  locust bean gum  so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake  you can use this on top  as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.\n","Summary:  ['This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts']\n","\n","Original Text:  My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone.

My most recent purchase  however  was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1 4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This  they claimed  also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new crop sugar will have a 6 10 digit date code  without ANY spaces  that ends with a  1  and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar.  My recent bad purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a  51A  .

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color  flavor was way off  the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e mailed Kettle with the following   What Happened  I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste  It tastes  cheaper . I do not know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch  I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.  I did receive a reply   Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections  and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color but our chips should still taste great Thanks for providing us with the  best before  code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br  >We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters  believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase  In case you buy this product again  we suggest avoiding the same best before date  if you still have it  in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br  >Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help.  Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the  bad  bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition  sell product to mass merchants  lower quality cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.

These chips do not have any sour to them at all  and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste. If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.

It is old fashioned drink from Michigan  since 1866  and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence  is smoother and more moist  and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale  very good. A ginger ale is more dry  higher in carbonation  and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can  versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br  ><br  >The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use  rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again  although it costs more  to get a better taste. Vernor s is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years  no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known  like other ginger drinks  for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br  >Vernor s is a regional soda  and there are many areas of the country you cannot find it in.

The sausage I used in dirty rice  the hamburger I used for taco salad  the chicken with wild rice  and the pork with stuffing. the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I do not eat it.

The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too  it is not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either  though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned  at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring.

Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round  full flavor in the middle. Doesn t have the complex ending flavors. For me  the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman s full middle flavor is a plus. I prefere Kikoman  especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.

I have not tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor  which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br  > Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.

I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states  its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate.

Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good  ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime . What I received was not the picture shown on the front page  2 per pack japanese pocky   it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion  the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste  more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth  this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br  ><br  >Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a  not eat everything at once and b  avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I will not be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I will not change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3.

I discovered these snacks at an anime convention  though I d heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them . They are very  very slim sticks of biscuity stuff  the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels  that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor  a nice non bitter  non dark  generically pleasing choco taste  seems to be the most popular  given how fast they sell out at cons   but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream.

There is no escaping the fact  however  that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation. Still  the McCann s is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It s even better than the organic  all natural brands I have tried. All the varieties in the McCann s variety pack taste good. It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br  ><br  >McCann s use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product. Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like  though  is McCann s use of thickeners. Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy  tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product. Maybe the guar gum is why  after sitting in the bowl a while  the instant McCann s becomes too thick and gluey.\n","summarized text:  McCann s Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal\n","Original text:  This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.

It s all good  that is for sure  and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br  > This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored  as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann s and other well known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann s is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea  diarrhea   headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell. I thought I d found sugar free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in. The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping. As the symptoms passed  this too was very unpleasant. Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit  all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar free popcorn at my local market. The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy  new sugarfree treat taste so good  my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener  down to the very bottom of the label and read  maltitol  in tiny little letters  Thank goodness I d eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart s content but others  like me  can have a bad reaction to it. In case you are like me  ... it is not you ...it s the maltitol \n","summarized text:  maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body\n","Original text:  It is okay.

I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together. I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit. I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits. Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier  coffe and other drinks do not    the only healthier drink is quality cold water. In my opinion  for the price  Royal King 100  Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas. This green tea has a beautiful golden color  the taste is bright and fresh. I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too. I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea  Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing  but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea  although I would if I could afford it .<br  ><br  >Cons  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped. The one shipped displays  NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS   a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea   whereas the Amazon package displays  CAFFENE FREE . So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not. The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.\n","summarized text:  royal King 100 Natural Organic Green Tea 100 tea bags x 2g each.

The female  younger one took to it right away  and the older male  who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it  and would usually refuse a diet change  actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor s request  but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories  the fatty  but at least I know he is eating good food. Of course  I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market  but I just cannot see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there  marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal  Is that right  I ll stay with this for now  but stay tuned.<br  ><br  >I m updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much  but he is just a big cat who does not exercise much  let us face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she is so healthy. She s tiny  but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select  but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I ve ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.\n","summarized text:  the older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor\n","Original text:  I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his  spunk  so I decided it was time to start buying him  real  cat food...not the garbage in the super markets.

I always offered both canned and dry  but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova s manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples  from my local holistic pet store  Holistic Select was the only one  other than the usual Wellness and Innova  they would eat. For finicky cats  I recommend trying Holistic Select.

I am about to make one for a pie auction at church  after a friend requested that something  strawberry  should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively  healthy  fruit tarts by baking a base  layering it with uncooked  fresh  sliced fruit  then pouring over the made up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature  hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart  and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes  to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally  I do not like cheesecake  too rich for me  but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous  I will admit. To do this  slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it is still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze  let it set up and then remove the springform. You ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries  strawberries or sliced mangos are nice  but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons  that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br  ><br  >I use a base of sponge cake  baked in a shallow form  but other bases can be pate sucre  a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie  that works well in those fluted  straight sided forms. You can also make mini tarts in a muffin pan  pre baking each mold with a layer of pie crust  even commercial crust works  though again  I prefer pate sucre  it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.  Just blind bake the muffin tins lined with pate  then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits  berries are great  and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie  which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br  ><br  >If you get into baking  this glaze is a must have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan  tapioca starch  carrageenan  dextrose  cream of tartar  locust bean gum  so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake  you can use this on top  as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.\n","summarized text:  you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base layering\n","Original text:  My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone.

Most energy drinks cannot be made w  out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL   probably lower than other un healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b c they contain too much caffeine and or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine  Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w  1 full Guayaki shot but not w  out all the other caffeine side effects   irritability  nervousness  mood swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br  ><br  >Now you are NOT sensitive to caffeine  then it is a great buy. It s not loaded w  sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It s not loaded w  a bunch of chemicals like 5 Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body weight.<br  ><br  >Side note   if you want to feel energized during the day  have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy  fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy \n","summarized text:  the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL probably lower than other\n","Original text:  These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect.

My most recent purchase  however  was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1 4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This  they claimed  also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new crop sugar will have a 6 10 digit date code  without ANY spaces  that ends with a  1  and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar.  My recent bad purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a  51A  .

They were mostly large pieces  re hydrated well and had good flavor. I d estimate about 25  of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces  most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount  perhaps an ounce or so  of very small minced size dust like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted <br  ><br  >The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br  ><br  >I m quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones  the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally  I find the broth used to re hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor  I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom infused water.<br  ><br  >This was the first time I used the Roland brand  got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse   and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.\n","summarized text:  about 25 of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces most likely due to the shaking about\n","Original text:  If you are a peanut lover  these are for you.

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color  flavor was way off  the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e mailed Kettle with the following   What Happened  I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste  It tastes  cheaper . I do not know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch  I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.  I did receive a reply   Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections  and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color but our chips should still taste great Thanks for providing us with the  best before  code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br  >We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters  believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase  In case you buy this product again  we suggest avoiding the same best before date  if you still have it  in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br  >Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help.  Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the  bad  bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition  sell product to mass merchants  lower quality cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...\n","summarized text:  a year ago I picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the bad bag.\n","Original text:  Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I did not put them out because the buffet was full and did not think anyone would like saltless potato chips.

With that said  they DO make fantastic plain chips. Thick cuts of potato  fried to a dark golden brown. They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt. I cannot recommend these chips enough. You will not regret it.<br  ><br  >Some people say they are burnt but they aren t. From their website   Take a quick look and you will see an immediate difference  Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking  the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize  creating chips from light gold to a deep amber. The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors  and an artisanal display in every bag <br  ><br  >Some have also said that these chips are oily  which is true. But they explain that on their website   At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand® products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are  trans fat free  meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br  ><br  >You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor. I m also a fan of their unsalted potato chips. For those of us watching our salt intake  the unsalted chips is the best you can get.

If you like plain potato chips  you would like these. They are thicker than most brands  fresh out of box  very crunchy and not too salty  for me . One bag has a lot  I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily  some chips almost look transparent  if you know what I mean . The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice  except salt  as the name says.

Well being used to the cheaper chips I was not expecting how mellow these things are. The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I did not mind but they had tons of flavor. These chips do not have any sour to them at all  and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste. If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first. So  for the price and how many you get  these chips are definately worth it. They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.

It is old fashioned drink from Michigan  since 1866  and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence  is smoother and more moist  and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale  very good. A ginger ale is more dry  higher in carbonation  and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can  versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br  ><br  >The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use  rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again  although it costs more  to get a better taste. Vernor s is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years  no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known  like other ginger drinks  for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br  >Vernor s is a regional soda  and there are many areas of the country you cannot find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon  at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment.

The sausage I used in dirty rice  the hamburger I used for taco salad  the chicken with wild rice  and the pork with stuffing. the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I do not eat it. The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can. There were not large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans  which I ve experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too  it is not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either  though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned  at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring.

But it is not super wonderful better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market. The main value is as a unique gift.<br  > In the Japanese soy sauce world  there are 4 types  regular  mild  usukuchi   for raw fish  sashimi  and light colored. Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style. Compared to Kikoman  a good commercial brand that is widely available  Bluegrass starts saltier  is flat in the middle  then ends with a complex   interesting flavor. Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round  full flavor in the middle. Doesn t have the complex ending flavors. For me  the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman s full middle flavor is a plus. I prefere Kikoman  especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct. But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor. I have not tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor  which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br  > Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce. Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.

Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good  ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime . What I received was not the picture shown on the front page  2 per pack japanese pocky   it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion  the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste  more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth  this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br  ><br  >Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a  not eat everything at once and b  avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I will not be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I will not change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste is not  terrible  but its definitely not to my liking.

Unless you are really prone to binge eating or cannot stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat  3 of them saturated. I would not recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact  just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br  ><br  >If you love the flavor of coconut chocolate together  like Almond Joy  try the coconut chocolate ones. They re really so good  oh man.

About the size of a gum ball  these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br  ><br  >Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea  the flavor is mild  but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas  but this one is quite balanced and tasty.

The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and do not get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br  ><br  >I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart  though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact.

My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br  ><br  >The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.\n","summarized text:  so far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing\n","Original text:  absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs  sandwiches most anything for a good kick  have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product...have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product..get out there and try it \n","summarized text:  theis homegrown chef and the product have been praised for their highes accolades\n","Original text:  BLACK MARKET HOT SAUCE IS WONDERFUL....

Like the other low star reviewer  I got suckered by seeing  habenero  in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor  citrus y and it has some fish sauce in the mix  according to the ingredient label   but if you are looking for hot this am not it\n","summarized text:  if you are looking for hot this am not it it's hot at all.\n","Original text:  I have to admit  I was a sucker for the large quantity  12 oz  when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle  it reminds of wing sauce bottle sizes. Plastic bottle. It does have a convenient squirt top. But overall  not very hot or tasty  and made mostly from jalape ntilde os.
